          <h4>WHY I CHOSE A CAREER IN FINANCIAL PLANNING</h4>
          <p class="muted">I have always been drawn to the idea of wealth accumulation and the long-term opportunities created through financial planning. From a young age, I had a natural entrepreneurial mindset and was often buying and reselling items such as limited clothing, sneakers, and thrifted finds, with the goal of identifying value for a cheap price and selling said item at a markup. That same mindset carries over to the stock market. The process of identifying companies that appear undervalued on paper, and investing in them before broader public recognition takes place. I've always been fascinated by how those simple concepts such as buying and selling clothing or shoes go hand in hand with the complexity of public markets. I also chose financial planning because of the discipline it requires. I consider myself an extremely disciplined individual so that was a factor in choosing this career path. I believe Sound money management and seeking to successfully invest demands emotional control, patience, and consistency. I strongly believe that how you do anything is how you do everything—and in finance, discipline comes first. Additionally, I chose this career path because I enjoy providing clarity and peace of mind to people who feel uncertain or overwhelmed by their financial situation. I am often surprised by how many individuals lack a clear understanding of their current or future financial position. Financial planning allows me to bring structure, understanding, and confidence to an area of life that is too often neglected.</p>
          <h4>MY LIFE OUTSIDE OF WORK</h4>
          <p class="muted">Outside of the office, I prioritize habits that support long-term health, happiness, and peace of mind. I enjoy reading, working out, running, snowboarding, and golfing—activities that reinforce consistency, focus, and balance. I also maintain a daily cold plunge and sauna routine, which has become an important part of my approach to physical recovery and mental resilience. These practices reflect the same principles I value in financial planning: preparation, discipline, and a long term mindset/futureistic thinking. I believe financial success should enhance quality of life, not distract from it, and I strive to live by the same standards I help my clients build toward.</p>

          <div class="role">Founder &amp; Head of Investments</div>
          <h4>WHY I CHOSE A CAREER IN FINANCIAL PLANNING</h4>
          <p class="muted">I have always been drawn to systems, discipline, and long-term thinking. Whether it was training in the gym, competing in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, or building businesses, I learned early that results come from doing the right things consistently over time. I believe Financial planning works the same way. Most people do not lack intelligence or ambition. They lack clarity, structure, and a plan they actually believe in. I chose this career because I enjoy helping people bring order to complexity and confidence to their financial decisions. Clients often come to LEGES with scattered accounts, competing advice, and unanswered questions. My role is to simplify the noise, identify what truly matters, and build a strategy that aligns with their life, values, and long-term goals. The combination of analytical planning and real-world decision making is what keeps this work challenging and rewarding.</p>
          <h4>MY LIFE OUTSIDE OF WORK</h4>
          <p class="muted">Outside of the office, I am deeply committed to health, discipline, and community. I train Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu regularly and compete at a high level, which has shaped the way I think about preparation, patience, and resilience. I am active in local fitness and wellness communities throughout the Phoenix and Scottsdale area and value relationships built through shared effort and accountability. These communities have reinforced what I see every day in planning. Strong outcomes are built through consistency, not shortcuts. I believe financial success should support a full life, not consume it.
