          <h4>WHY I CHOSE A CAREER IN FINANCIAL PLANNING</h4>
          <p class="muted">I have always been drawn to the concept of wealth accumulation and the long-term opportunities created through financial planning. From a young age, I had a natural entrepreneurial mindset. I regularly bought and resold limited clothing, sneakers, and thrifted finds, focusing on identifying undervalued items and selling them at a premium. That early experience taught me a foundational principle: value is often recognized by those willing to look deeper and act before the crowd.
            That same mindset carries over into the stock market. I am fascinated by the process of identifying companies that appear undervalued on paper and investing in them before broader public recognition takes place. What began as buying and selling clothing evolved into an appreciation for the complexity and strategy of public markets. At their core, both rely on understanding value, exercising patience, and executing with discipline.
            Discipline is one of the primary reasons I chose financial planning as a career. I consider myself a highly disciplined individual, and sound money management demands emotional control, patience, and consistency. I strongly believe that how you do anything is how you do everything, and in finance, discipline comes first. Markets fluctuate, emotions follow, but long-term success belongs to those who remain steady.
            I was also drawn to this field because of the clarity and peace of mind it can provide. I am often surprised by how many individuals lack a clear understanding of their current or future financial position. Financial planning allows me to bring structure, perspective, and confidence to an area of life that is too often neglected or misunderstood. Helping people feel organized and empowered about their future is deeply meaningful to me.
            </p>
          <h4>MY LIFE OUTSIDE OF WORK</h4>
          <p class="muted">Outside of the office, I prioritize habits that support long-term health, happiness, and peace of mind. I enjoy reading, working out, running, snowboarding, and golfing, all activities that reinforce consistency, focus, and balance.
            I also maintain a daily cold plunge and sauna routine, which has become central to both my physical recovery and mental resilience. These practices reflect the same principles I value in financial planning: preparation, discipline, and long-term thinking.
            I believe financial success should enhance quality of life, not distract from it. Here at LEGES our goal is to do just that. Outsourcing the burden of managing finances to us, in order to give our clients more time to do the things in life that they love to do.

          <div class="role">Founder and Head of Planning</div>
          <h4>WHY I CHOSE A CAREER IN FINANCIAL PLANNING</h4>
          <p class="muted">I have always been drawn to systems, discipline, and long-term thinking. Whether it was training in the gym, competing in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, or building businesses, I learned early that results come from doing the right things consistently over time. I believe Financial planning works the same way. Most people do not lack intelligence or ambition. They lack clarity, structure, and a plan they actually believe in. I chose this career because I enjoy helping people bring order to complexity and confidence to their financial decisions. Clients often come to LEGES with scattered accounts, competing advice, and unanswered questions. My goal is to simplify the noise, identify what truly matters, and build a strategy that aligns with their life, values, and long-term goals. The combination of analytical planning and real-world decision making is what keeps this work challenging and rewarding.</p>
          <h4>MY LIFE OUTSIDE OF WORK</h4>
          <p class="muted">Outside of the office, I am deeply committed to health, discipline, and community. I train Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu regularly and compete at a high level, which has shaped the way I think about preparation, patience, and resilience. I am active in local fitness and wellness communities throughout the Phoenix and Scottsdale area and value relationships built through shared effort and accountability.  I believe financial success should support a full life, not consume it.
