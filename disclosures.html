          Leges Wealth Management LLC ("Leges Wealth") is a Registered Investment Advisor with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Registration as an investment advisor does not imply any level of skill or training. Past performance may not be indicative of future results. Different types of investments involve varying degrees of risk. Therefore, it should not be assumed that future performance of any specific investment or investment strategy will be profitable.
          Asset allocation may be used in an effort to manage risk and enhance returns. It does not, however, guarantee a profit or protect against loss. Performance of the asset allocation strategies depends on the underlying investments.
